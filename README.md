Automated detection and discrimination of circular trading fraud on trade receivables and invoice discounting platforms (TReDS).


---

## Overview

Circular trading is a systemic financial fraud mechanism where a syndicate of affiliated entities issues circular chains of fabricated invoices ($E_1 \rightarrow E_2 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow E_k \rightarrow E_1$). The objectives include artificial turnover inflation, fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC) extraction, and the repeated discounting of non-existent trade receivables across multiple financing institutions.

Circe resolves two fundamental operational challenges in financial network surveillance:

1. **The Hairball Problem**: Legitimate supply chains naturally exhibit cyclic commerce (e.g., raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, assemblers, and logistics distributors). Topologically identifying a cycle is insufficient; the system must rigorously distinguish genuine economic loops from circular fraud.
2. **The Missing Leg Problem**: Sophisticated fraud syndicates deliberately avoid closing the circular invoice chain on-ledger, utilizing off-platform cash settlements or informal arrangements for the terminal leg ($E_k \dots E_1$). Circe bridges unclosed invoice paths by extracting cross-entity corporate metadata (shared directors, registered office addresses, and incorporation dates) to uncover the hidden loop.

## System Architecture

Circe operates as a modular, schema-enforced pipeline structured into four distinct layers:

```

## Core Modules and Capabilities

### 1. Graph Topology and Corporate Closure (`graph/`)

The graph engine constructs directed multigraphs from raw invoice ledgers and identifies candidate fraud topologies:

* **Strongly Connected Component (SCC) Decomposition (`graph/scc.py`)**: Uses an iterative implementation of Tarjan's algorithm to partition the global platform graph into disjoint SCCs, pruning non-cyclic subgraphs in linear time $O(V + E)$.
* **Depth-Limited Cycle Search (`graph/cycles.py`)**: Traverses SCCs using a depth-bounded DFS (default: depth 8) with canonical-start vertex ordering to guarantee that every simple cycle is enumerated exactly once without redundant permutations. Includes hard search-step and cycle-count execution budgets to prevent algorithmic stalls on dense subgraphs.
* **Corporate-Graph Closure (`graph/corporate.py`)**: For unclosed invoice chains ($E_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow E_k$), the engine computes pairwise corporate affinity between $E_k$ and $E_1$. If the terminal entities share a Director Identification Number (DIN), physical address, or registration timestamp, a synthetic `corporate` bridge edge is instantiated, recovering the ring at 1.00 Jaccard similarity.
* **Entity Canonicalization (`graph/canonicalize.py`)**: Resolves entity aliasing by blocking on strict normalized `(name, address)` tuples to prevent synthetic identity fragmentation.

### 2. Multi-Factor Fraud Scoring Engine (`scoring/`)

Each candidate ring is evaluated across eight orthogonal financial, physical, and corporate dimensions:

| Signal | Identifier | Mathematical / Logical Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Flow Conservation | `s_flow` | Variance of invoice amounts across consecutive hops; fabricated loops exhibit near-identical nominal values ($S_{\text{flow}} \approx 1.0$). |
| Product Continuity | `s_product` | Harmonized System (HS) commodity code progression; tracks raw material $\rightarrow$ intermediate $\rightarrow$ finished goods transitions vs. identical commodity round-tripping. |
| Economic Isolation | `s_externality` | Ratio of internal ring invoice volume to total platform trade of member entities; shell networks operate with near-zero outside trade. |
| Timing Anomalies | `s_timing` | Velocity and temporal sequencing of invoices; flags ultra-short round-trip durations or out-of-order financing requests. |
| Corporate Density | `s_corporate` | Pairwise corporate linkage density among ring participants (shared DINs, registered addresses, incorporation dates). |
| Industry Incongruity | `s_industry` | National Industrial Classification (NIC/SIC) compatibility across transacting pairs (e.g., agricultural firm billing software consultancy). |
| Financing Velocity | `s_discounting` | Platform discounting frequency and outstanding exposure relative to net asset capitalization. |
| Amount Uniformity | `s_amount` | Degree of gross transaction value roundness and round-trip capital conservation. |

**Signal Abstention Protocol**: When input records lack non-mandatory metadata (e.g., unassigned HS commodity codes), the corresponding signal explicitly enters an `ABSTAINED` state rather than assigning an artificial $0.0$ or $1.0$, preserving aggregate score integrity.

**Expected Loss Formulation**:
$$\text{Aggregate Risk Score} = \sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i \cdot S_i \quad \text{where } \sum w_i = 1.0$$
$$\text{Expected Loss} = \text{Aggregate Risk Score} \times \text{Gross Platform Exposure}$$

### 3. Investigator Intelligence Console (`demo/` and `console/`)

A browser-based investigative platform designed around the Counsel financial design standard:

* **Review Queue (`01 REVIEW`)**: Displays prioritized rings ranked by expected loss. Features isolated, per-ring vector SVG visualizations with geometric node clearance, directional arrows, and hatched abstention signal bars.
* **Interconnection Topology (`02 VISUALISE`)**: Interactive WebGL and SVG platform map supporting pan, zoom, component filtering, and individual entity trajectory inspection.
* **Entity Directory (`03 INVESTIGATE`)**: Searchable index of all transacting corporations, displaying NIC sectors, total invoice velocity, associated ring counts, and gross platform exposure.
* **Invoice Ledger & Simulation Sandbox (`04 VERIFY`)**: Paginated raw ledger with modal invoice inspectors. Includes an interactive `+ Add Invoice` facility that submits new trade records to `/api/rescore`, dynamically re-executing Tarjan cycle discovery and 8-signal scoring in real time.

## Testing and Verification

The test suite covers unit logic, graph invariants, cycle search budgets, corporate bridge detection, schema contracts, and adversarial fraud detection benchmarks:

Execute all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Run internal scoring checks and adversarial benchmarks:
```bash
python scoring/scoring.py
```

---

## Running the Application

### Local Development Server

Launch the dual-stack development server supporting both static asset serving and the live `/api/rescore` endpoint:
```bash
python server.py 8000
```

Access the interfaces:
* Production Demo: `http://localhost:8000/demo/`
* Analyst Console: `http://localhost:8000/console/`
* Health Check: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`

### Production Deployment (Vercel)

The repository includes a production-ready `vercel.json` and dedicated serverless handlers in `api/`:

* Static assets in `demo/`, `console/`, and `index.html` are deployed directly to Vercel's Edge CDN (`@vercel/static`).
* Python endpoints in `api/health.py` and `api/rescore.py` execute as on-demand Serverless Functions (`@vercel/python`).

Deploy using the Vercel CLI or by connecting the GitHub repository:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

## Benchmark Results

Evaluated against the ground-truth benchmark dataset (`data/ground_truth.json`):

* **Recall**: 100% (6/6 injected fraud rings identified).
* **Corporate-Closed Ring Discovery**: Recovered hidden-leg rings (`T04`, `T06`) at 1.00 Jaccard similarity via pairwise director, address, and registration linkages.
* **Precision@6**: 66.7% (top-ranked candidate is a confirmed fraud syndicate).
* **Determinism**: 100% reproducible across operating systems via canonical coordinate layout algorithms and deterministic ID hashing.
